# Campaign Management Template with SQL Server 2016 R Services â€“ Template Contents

The following is the directory structure for this template:

- [**Data**](#copy-of-input-datasets)  This contains the copy of the simulated input data
- [**R**](#model-development-in-r)  This contains the R codes to simulate the input datasets, create the analytical datasets, train the models, identify champion model and score the analytical/scorings dataset
- [**Resources**](#resources-for-the-solution-packet) This directory contains the detailed description and instructions for this packet as well as the PowerBI file used to visualize results
- [**SQLR**](#model-development-in-sql-server-2016-r-services) This contains the SQLR codes to simulate the input datasets, create the analytical datasets, train the models, identify champion model and score the analytical/scorings dataset. It also contains PowerShell scripts automate the entire process

In this template with SQL Server R Services, three versions of the implementation module have been showcased:

1. [**Model Development in R IDE**](#model-development-in-r)  . Run the R code in R IDE (e.g., RStudio, R Tools for Visual Studio).
2. [**Model Development in SQL**](#model-development-in-sql-server-2016-r-services). Run the SQL code in SQL Server using SQLR scripts
3. [**Automation in PowerShell**](#automation-with-powershell). Run the PowerShell scripts which automates the Model Development and Scoring Process
